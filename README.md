Crystal Mayhem!
A crystal collecting game built with jQuery.

Four crystals are assigned random numbers between 1 and 12. You will click on them to accumulate points to match another random number between 19 and 120 that is displayed at the top of the screen. If you match the target number, you win. (Yay!) If you go over the target number, the computer wins. (Boo!)

Enjoy!
